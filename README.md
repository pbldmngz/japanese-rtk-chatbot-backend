# japanese-rtk-chatbot-backend
 Maintain a conversation in japanese while being able to configure dificulty directly + give a direct use to what you learnt with RTK

## Note for the future:

This app is meant to be a free, reliable, useful tool for learning Japanese. That means new functions can be implemented on that front.

- We need a way to capture input, and maybe compare pronunciation in a simplified manner using voice to text, and then that text transform it to voice to see how much it matches the example (just an idea)
- Have a basic layer (of just the chatbot) and maybe delimit the amount of credits available daily so it doesnt become too expensive. Every new AI based functionality has a cost.
- Have text to voice from the chat so it looks more like a voice message than a text message and use it sparringly so it balances expenses with value.
- Make use of existing dictionaries for the words and meanings as an alternative so the conversation can keep going but we don't have to look up for translations and we get meanings in japanese too.
- Improve the interface... Yeah didn't do a great job on it.

Haven't really started any open source proyects of my own, so this will be it. It's an experiment which will hopefuly benefit many. Be welcome to it and feel free to contact me or to post any kind of contribution to the code.

Thank you!
